## Image Segmentation App(using kmeans algo OPEN-CV-PYTHON)

IF USING PHONE ==== 

###### after uploading the photo kindly see thr TOP LEFT of the SCREEN , you will find a ">"[ARROW]

use this arrow[>] to see edges of your image👍👍

This webapp can segment your image into multiple color [depending on your image] and 
the K[cluters] value you select!!

to select the number of K- [use the slider]

at k ==2:
  the image will be black and white 
  
  
at k ==3&4[MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE]:
  the major colors of the image will get segmented first !!!

the maximum k value i made in this app is 7

after this the RESULTS WERE NOT GOOD....

I had many boring looking photos

which really look good AFTER

segmented from this webapp 

hope you like the it😄😄
